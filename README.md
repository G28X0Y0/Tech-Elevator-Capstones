# Tech-Elevator-Capstones
These are my projects I was assigned during my time at Tech Elevator.
There are pdfs in each one explaining the scope for them.

## Building and Running
- All of my projects were built using ***IntelliJ***
- Depencies and building were with ***Maven***
- For server based applications (like the weather app), do ```npm start``` in the server directory.

- The projects are ran on ```localhost``` See individual web projects for specific ports.

## Goals

These are meant as a small portfolio from my time at Tech Elevator.
For more projects, feel free to look around my repos. I'm still
a junior developer and will continue to add more as I learn more.
Thank you for taking a look!
